    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Both plots evaluate the running time of both algorithms `maximize_value` and `FindMaxProdRec` in the range of 2 to 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plot 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The first plot represents a <u>theoretical</u> implementation of what the running times should be according to our intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plot 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The second plot captures the running times of the two algorithms as n increases (from 2 to 25) according to the <u>%timeit</u> function that measures the execution time of our code, in this case, the two implemented functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two plots we can clearly see that `maximize_value` (blue line) runs in a linear time and `FindMaxProdRec`(red line) runs in an exponential time. For n > 20, we can really start to see a difference between their execution (running) times: `FindMaxProdRec` becomes unpractical. In fact, for even bigger values of n, our computer is not able to run the function unlike `maximize_value` which returns the expected output instantly."
